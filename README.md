5.  The files/documents are put into a blocking queue.
6.  A hash code is then generated for each word.
7.  The hash codes are grouped into shinges of 6 hash codes per shingle.
8.  The shingles are put into 2 seperate lists.
9.  The jaccard similarity co-efficient is applied to compare the 2 files/documents.
10. The similarity between the files/documents is then outputted to the console.
